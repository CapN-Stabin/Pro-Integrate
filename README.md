# Pro-Integrate
First version of a “Integrate Apps for Dummies” that specifically is designed to help pull all 3rd party apps, along with Microsoft Store apps into one easy to use panel where the user will be able to see which apps can be integrated with what, to make all apps work together instead of having to rely on multi-Tabs. Truly a One Network.
